## 🌟 Features

Based on the project documentation, the application includes the following capabilities:

* **Interactive Canvas:** A fixed 800x600 drawing area using HTML5 Canvas.
* **Graph Types:** Toggle between **Directed** (arrows) and **Undirected** (lines) graphs.
* **Node Operations:**
    * Add nodes manually by clicking on the canvas.
    * Add nodes automatically in a grid layout.
    * Drag and drop functionality to rearrange nodes.
    * Customizable indexing start (0 or 1).
* **Edge Operations:**
    * Connect nodes visually (click Source -> click Target).
    * Add edges programmatically via input fields.
    * Validation to prevent self-loops and duplicate edges.
* **Management:**
    * **Delete Mode:** Remove specific nodes or edges by clicking them.
    * **Clear All:** Reset the entire workspace.
    * **Export:** Download the current graph visualization as a `.png` file.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structure and layout.
* **CSS3:** Styling and user interface responsiveness.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Logic, state management, and Canvas API rendering.
